# Getting Started

Welcome to the CloudBolt CMP Bootcamp!

This course was first taught in 2018 as a comprehensive training course for internal staff and partners. Since then, variations of this course have been used to enable customers, employees, and partners all over the World.

In addition to learning about our CMP product in detail, our Bootcamp participants are exposed to some core concepts around IT and cloud automation. These concepts include remote code execution, key management, infrastructure-as-code, and interaction with cloud APIs.

By the end of this course, participants should have everything they need to deploy and configure CMP as a self-service portal in almost any enterprise whether that enterprise is on-premises only, have embraced one-or-more public clouds or, as in most cases, are operating a hybrid cloud environment.
