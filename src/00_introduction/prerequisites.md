# Prerequisites

## Linux Terminal Experience
Bootcamp participants are expected to know how to open a terminal and login to a remote linux host via SSH. Basic Linux skills such as using vi, file management, and bash will be assumed by the instructors.

## Familiarity with Scripting
This includes an understanding of basic concepts such as variables, functions, as well as primitive data types like strings, numbers, arrays, and dictionaries. Basic Python knowledge will be useful, but not required.

## General Networking Concepts
Working across public and private cloud environments requires a basic level of understanding of TCP/IP networking concepts like IP addresses, TCP/UDP ports, general connectivity, and DNS.

## HTTP-based APIs
HTTP-based APIs, whether in the form of REST, XMLRPC, or other calling conventions, are the glue that binds services together when it comes to orchestration and automation. A basic understanding of how to create these calls in any tool including, curl, Postman, HTTPie, or from scripting/programming languages will be helpful.

## Web- and host-based Encryption Protocols
Today's modern Web and its APIs are for the most part now encrypted by default. Understanding the basics behind encryption schemes such as SSL and asymmetric encryption (public/private keys) will help navigate the security protocols protecting today's communication between systems.

## Soft-skills
Deploying CloudBolt CMP with the goal of providing self-service access to infrastructure, services, and applications requires a combination of diplomacy, humility, and technical skill. Often requiring the interaction with multiple teams, each with their own agenda, technologies, and processes, soft-skills are key to delivering success. Additional skills such as being able to troubleshoot cross domain and team technologies, and the ability to take notes and organize documentation are also crucial.
