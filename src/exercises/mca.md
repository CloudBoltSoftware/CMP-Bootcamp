# Exercise: Multichannel Alerts

## Use-Case
As part of our CloudBolt deployment, all security and administrative alerts generated by CloudBolt should be collected and displayed where the security team can monitor and review.

## Solution
Create a multichannel alert that captures these alerts and forwards them to a designated Microsoft Teams channel configured with a webhook

## Implementation
1. Go to "Admin > Multi-Channel Alerts", click "New Alert Channel", and then click "Microsoft Teams".

2. In the "New Alert Channel - Microsoft Teams" set the values:
* **Name:** CloudBolt Alerts
* **Incoming Webhook Url:** Provided by Microsoft Teams when creating the Webhook
* **Alert Categories:** cloudbolt.admin cloudbolt.security

3. Click "Create".

## Usage

1. Logout of CloudBolt, then login.

2. You should see a message in the Teams channel assocaited with the Webhook URL.
