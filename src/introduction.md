## Cloud Management Platform (CMP)

The phrase Cloud Management Platform (CMP) has been around as long as the term "cloud" itself. In some respects, it pre-dates public cloud going back to the surge in data center automation sparked by the widespread adoption of Hypervisors such as VMware ESX and vCenter Server. Some would even argue that it started in the early aughts with the emergence of LoudCloud and Opsware whose vision was a software-defined data center and whose mission it was to automate all things IT -- including the dynamic provisioning of bare metal servers.

The definition of CMP has evolved with time. At first it was largely focused on transforming the private data center into a cloud and away from being an IT managed resource through which all requests, small and large passed. System administrators managed servers (virtual and physical) and data centers. IT help desks responded to tickets requesting additional resources. Networking teams ensured the networks were operating efficiently and were secured from external threats via border gateways, DMZs, and intrusion detection systems.

As the market for public cloud took off, early adopters enjoyed near-instant access to compute, networking, and storage, but this easy access magnified the resource management challenges of the past. Instead of a team of sysadmins managing data center assets and a service desk though which all requests passed, end-users were directly creating, configuring, and managing their own IT assets -- sometimes paying with their own credit cards!

Old and thorny IT issues such as VM sprawl, patch/configuration management, security posture is compounded, and new challenges emerge in the form of cost management/reporting, governance/compliance, and the complexities associated with end-users managing their own servers and networks. Further exacerbating these issues is the fact that many enterprises today are using some combination of public cloud providers and data center technologies, and there are no signs of changing.

Despite all the benefits delivered by Public Cloud, an age-old problem continues to confound enterprise IT: 

    How do we empower developers and technical teams to move faster without burdening them with crushing overhead in the form of expertise in: networking, public cloud knowledge, security, operations, cost accounting, and DevOps?

## The CloudBolt Platform

Initially built on the foundation of self-service IT and visibility provided by CloudBolt CMP, the CloudBolt product portfolio has since expanded to address the challenges mentioned above by incorporating the cost management and compliance reporting capabilities delivered by CSMP (Cost & Security Management Platform). The combination of these products and the unparalleled time-to-value delivered by the CloudBolt Platform help enterprises meet the demands and challenges presented by multi- and hybrid-cloud environments. 

    The CloudBolt Platform helps address complexity through active Self-Service which leverages implicit governance to ensure workloads can be deployed quickly and easily by citizen developers while providing actionable cost management and compliance reporting across on-prem and public cloud environments.

This course will be focused on CloudBolt CMP, however integration with the Cost and Security Management Platform (CSMP) will be covered in detail.

## CloudBolt CMP

CloudBolt CMP was initially developed in 2012 and has since evolved from being a product focused on exposing data center technologies to a full-fledged Self-Service IT platform that works across all major clouds -- public and private. Its focus providing an answer to the question posed above by enterprise IT has been critical to customer acquisition and success. With each release, this ability to empower technical teams to move faster grows stronger. 

New tools and techniques are deployed at a frenetic pace in today's IT enterprise contributing to complexity -- the enemy of agility and  digital transformation. A major strength of CloudBolt CMP is its ability to grow and evolve with new trends in IT automation such as infrastructure-as-code, containers; as well as new operational models such as DevOps and CI/CD. 

    CloudBolt CMP wraps the increasingly complex web of automation tools and processes under a single umbrella of orchestration to hide this complexity and ultimately provide a sustainable mechanism for tool consumption and rationalization.

## CloudBolt CMP Bootcamp

This course starts with the deployment and management of CloudBolt CMP, covers the integration of CloudBolt CMP with existing customer systems, and ultimately concludes with the creation of new content in the form of Blueprints, integrations, and extensions. 

At the end of this course, participants should have everything they need to fully implement CloudBolt CMP in most enterprise IT environments. These environments are as unique as they are similar, and participants will be armed with the ability to handle and embrace this uniqueness through the extensibility offered by CloudBolt CMP.
